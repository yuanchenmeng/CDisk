This Cloud Storage Qt Application involves developing a sophisticated TCP Socket and TCP Client using Qt, integrated with an SQLite3 database to efficiently manage user information. The application leverages QDir and QFile to simulate a Linux file system, incorporating essential features such as directory navigation, file deletion, and file movement to deliver a seamless cloud storage experience. To enhance performance and ensure responsive user interactions, multi-threading and timers have been implemented, optimizing the process of file uploads and downloads.
